/**
 * Incidences annotate getters and adders to represent a Vertex incident to an Edge. This annotation extends the
 * TinkerPop built-in Incidence annotation. It allows type arguments to be passed into the annotated method. This

 *
 *
 * T add*(Class&lt;T&gt; type)
 * T get*(Class&lt;T&gt; type)
 *
 * When annotating a get* class it ensures it only returns nodes of the specified type (including sub-classes). Any
 * Nodes which are not of this type will not be returned.
